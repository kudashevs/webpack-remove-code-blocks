Webpack Remove Code Blocks
==========================

This Webpack Remove Code Blocks package was originated from [Webpack Remove Block](https://github.com/ee01/webpack-remove-blocks). 

This is a webpack loader that removes blocks of code which were marked with the specific comment tags. It is useful
for removing the code that you don't want to see in production. This loader supports multiple block types.

The key difference form the original loader that the syntax is not limited by using `:start` and `:end` markers.

## Example

As an example, in place where we need to omit some code in our js files we can add the comments with the following syntax:

```javascript
/* debug:start */
console.log('debug');
/* debug:end */
var makeFoo = function(bar, baz) {
    // The following code will be removed with the loader
    /* devblock:start */
    if (bar instanceof Bar !== true) {
        throw new Error('makeFoo: bar param is required and must be instance of Bar');
    }
    /* devblock:end */

    /* devblock_start */
    if (baz instanceof Baz !== true) {
        throw new Error('makeFoo: baz param is required and must be instance of Baz');
    }
    /* devblock_end */

    // This code will remain
    return new Foo(bar, baz);
}
```

Then, we need to update our webpack config with the specific options and the loader:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components|\.spec\.js)/,
                use: [{
                    loader: 'webpack-remove-code-blocks',
                    options: {
                        'blocks': [
                            'debug',
                            'devblock',
                            {
                                start: 'devblock_start',
                                end: 'devblock_end',
                                prefix: '/*',
                                suffix: '*/'
                            }]
                    }
                }]
            }
        ]
    }
};
```

After a bundling process we will get the following result:
```javascript
var makeFoo = function(bar, baz) {
    // The following code will be removed with the loader


    // This code will remain
    return new Foo(bar, baz);
}
```
